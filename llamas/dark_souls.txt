Here are some example Dark Souls item and location descriptions:
Scythe born from the soul of Priscilla, the stark white crossbreed trapped inside the painted world of Ariamis. Even the Gods feared Priscilla's lifehunt ability, and in the hands of a mortal, its power will turn upon its wielder.
Large halberd made of old brass, used by the giant sentinels of Anor Londo. Brass contains traces of lightning, but as the halberd is designed for the giant sentinels, its weight is unbearable.
Widely-used standard straight sword, only matched in ubiquity by the shortsword. An accessible sword which inflicts consistent regular damage and high slash damage, making it applicable to a variety of situations.
The sword of the knights of the Four Kings of New Londo. Its blade is wide and thick and it is wielded in an unusual manner. When the Four Kings were seduced by evil, their knights became Darkwraiths, servants of the Dark who wielded these darkswords.
Metal hammer of Vamos, a skeleton blacksmith deep within the Catacombs who rarely speaks. Can be used as a strike weapon, but better left in the hands of its talented owner.
This black sprite is called humanity, but little is known about its true nature. If the soul is the source of all life, then what distinguishes the humanity we hold within ourselves?
This mystical ring was created in a sacrificial rite of Velka, the Goddess of Sin. Its wearer will lose nothing upon death, but the ring itself breaks.
Armor of the dragonslayer Ornstein, who guards the cathedral in the forsaken city of Anor Londo. Ornstein is believed to be the captain of the Four Knights. His golden lion helm is imbued with the power of lightning and should provide good protection against it.
Moss-covered armor of the Stone Knight, defender of the Darkroot Garden. The Stone Knight is a product of ancient magic, and although this armor is also imbued with magic, it is incredibly heavy.
Helm of the Channelers, sorcerers that serve Seath the Scaleless. The six eyes arranged in two vertical columns compensate for Seath's lack of sight. Apparel of the Channelers, sorcerers that serve Seath the Scaleless. Even after the onset of Seath's madness, the "snatchers," as they were often called, ventured to far lands to find suitable human specimens. The heaviest of protective gear for sorcerers, and imbued with magic.
Protection of Alva, seeker of the spurned. To this day, troubadours sing of tales of the Wandering knight Alva and his travels, and of his involvement with the saint and the witch. Needless to say, the songs traditionally end in tragedy.
Armour of the Drang Knights, proclaimed descendents of the land known for the legend of the Linking of the Fire. Fine protection that is both light and strong, having been reinforced with rare geisteel. The Drang knights were once feared sellswords, until treason meant descending into the abyss, and they were seperated forever.
Armour of the dark witch Karla. A pointed hat is the signature of a heretical sorceress. Karla, however always kept it close. This stained Armour is torn and odorous, telling of a long journey and even longer imprisonment. It would be madness to wear such a thing.
Attire of hunters known as the King's Black Hands. A black cape covers leather armor, shrouding the wearer in darkness. Black Hand was the title established to honor hunters who served successive generations of kings. To date, no more than three such individuals have borne this distinction.
